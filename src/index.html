                <span
                    >At this cry the whole ship's crew hurried towards the
                    harpoonerâ€”commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys;
                    even the engineers left their engines, and the stokers their
                    furnaces.</span

                <span
                    >The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate now
                    simply went on by her own momentum. The darkness was then
                    profound, and, however good the Canadian's eyes were, I
                    asked myself how he had managed to see, and what he had been
                    able to see. My heart beat as if it would break. But Ned
                    Land was not mistaken, and we all perceived the object he
                    pointed to. At two cables' length from the Abraham Lincoln,
                    on the starboard quarter, the sea seemed to be illuminated
                    all over. It was not a mere phosphoric phenomenon. The
                    monster emerged some fathoms from the water, and then threw
                    out that very intense but mysterious light mentioned in the
                    report of several captains. This magnificent irradiation
                    must have been produced by an agent of great SHINING power.
                    The luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval, much
                    elongated, the centre of which condensed a burning heat,
                    whose overpowering brilliancy died out by successive
                    gradations.</span
